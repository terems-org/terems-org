#WebZ Platform v0.9 beta (Pedesis)
WebZ Platform is going to be a Git-based web hosting platform. It's core is called WebZ Server. WebZ Server is written in Java and soon enough will become open-source (this page is already being served by it).  
Apart from being deployed as part of WebZ Platform, WebZ Server will also be accessible for download.  
WebZ Apps are JS-based web applications which UX developers will soon be able to host/serve directly from GitHub - pretty similar to what GitHub Pages allow us to do (WebZ Server also can have adapters for other storages like Dropbox etc. as well as for the local file system).

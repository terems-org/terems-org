WebZ Platform v0.9 beta (Pedesis)
============

For now let's just say that WebZ Platform is going to be some sort of a Web Experience Development Suite...

The idea behind the central page of the suite is to eventually become a fully-fledged Offline Web App which would be installed as an extension to Google Chrome in order to replace Chrome's default New Tab Page App and play a role of a la "Research" Bookmarking App. This app would allow for multiple "Researches" to be maintained per a registered user, each "Research" in a form of two columns: the first one would be a list of references to external articles and short summaries under those references (these summaries are to be put there by the user of the app to summarize why this particular article is mentioned in the current "Research" and which conclusions does it bring the researcher to) and the second one whould be a collection of button-like transparent panels mentioning what "source" websites (domain names, probably their brandings to be displayed as well) were used (in other words, which "sources" the links in the first column come from)...

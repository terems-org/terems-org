# [WebZ Platform](http://ww.webz.bz/) v0.9 beta ([Pedesis](https://www.pinterest.com/teremterem/pedesis-from-ancient-greek-a-leaping/))

WebZ Platform is going to be a Git-based web hosting platform. It's core is called **WebZ Server**. WebZ
Server is an [open source](https://github.com/terems-org/webz-server) server written in Java that is designed to serve web pages from various sources.

Apart from being deployed as part of WebZ Platform, WebZ Server will also be accessible for download.

WebZ Apps are JS-based web applications which UX developers will soon be able to host/serve directly
from GitHub - pretty similar to what GitHub Pages allow us to do (WebZ Server also can have adapters
for other storages like Dropbox etc. as well as for the local file system).

# [WebZ Platform](http://ww.webz.bz/) v0.9 beta ([Pedesis](https://www.pinterest.com/teremterem/pedesis-from-ancient-greek-a-leaping/))

WebZ Platform is going to be a Git-based web hosting platform. It's core is called WebZ Server. WebZ
Server is written in Java and published as an [open source project] ~(this page is already being served
by it)~.

Apart from being deployed as part of WebZ Platform, WebZ Server will also be accessible for download.

WebZ Apps are JS-based web applications which UX developers will soon be able to host/serve directly
from GitHub - pretty similar to what GitHub Pages allow us to do (WebZ Server also can have adapters
for other storages like Dropbox etc. as well as for the local file system).
